added notes.txt to randall.c

refactoring:
each .h file should have #include headers, example:
#ifndef RAND64_SW_H
#define RAND64_SW_H
...
#endif // RAND64_SW_H
and the required headers and function prototypes. 
the .c files should have only #include the .h file file.
in main, you need to #include the header file too
